## Question  
Pipeline Slows Down Over Time (Builds taking more time) — How Will You Fix?
in detail :- a developr triggers a feature branch but pipeline doesn't trigger?Why ?

### 📝 Short Explanation  
If a CI pipeline is progressively getting slower, it's likely due to **accumulated build artifacts**, **unoptimized steps**, **lack of caching**, or **resource saturation** on the runner/agent.

## ✅ Answer  

When I notice that builds are getting slower over time, I take a **metrics-driven approach** to isolate the slowdown and optimize the pipeline stages.

as devops engineer we should go to the CI file 
let say the team is using git hub action so you will go to the git hub actions yaml file and first thing you will check is 
so within github yaml file. you will se on :- as shown in the screenshot
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca3f6042-e443-4af8-83ac-0b272675452f)

so you will try to see the on: field and you will se if "on" field push and pull_request is properly configured or not because here developr directly trying to push to the feature. also may be if push is configured but there is exclude that is added to the push fields
so within "on" you can configured excludes and within excludes may be some body added feature because may be developr doesn't want run the pipeline on feature branch. So as a devops engineer we need to remove exclude tags.
### 🧭 Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Approach

#### 1. 📊 **Measure Stage Durations Over Time**
- Use CI tool metrics (Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab) or integrate Prometheus/Grafana.
- Identify **which stage(s)** are consuming more time — code checkout, dependency resolution, test execution, build packaging, etc.

---

#### 2. 📦 **Check Dependency Management**
- Over time, dependency trees can grow.
- Use tools like:
  - `mvn dependency:analyze`
  - `npm prune`
- Cache dependencies (e.g., `~/.m2`, `node_modules`) between runs to avoid full re-downloads.

---

#### 3. 💾 **Enable Layered and Incremental Builds**
- Avoid cleaning entire workspace unless necessary (`mvn clean install` can be expensive).
- Use incremental build options:
  - Gradle: `--build-cache`
  - Bazel: native caching
  - Docker: use layers wisely and avoid invalidating cache

---

#### 4. 🧼 **Clean Up Disk and Workspace**
- Runners may accumulate:
  - Gigabytes of build artifacts
  - Old Docker images and volumes
- Use scheduled jobs or add cleanup logic:
  ```bash
  docker system prune -af
  ```

---

#### 5. 🚀 **Use Parallelism and Matrix Builds**
- Split long test suites or build steps using:
  - `strategy.matrix` in GitHub Actions
  - `parallel` stages in Jenkins pipelines

---

#### 6. ⚙️ **Review Runner/Agent Resource Utilization**
- Check CPU, memory, disk I/O on build agents.
- Use autoscaling runners or move to faster instance types if needed.

### 🧠 Real-World Example

We noticed our build time increased from 7 to 19 minutes over 6 months.  
Root cause:  
- Increased number of tests without parallel execution  
- Outdated Docker layers not using cache  

✅ Fixes implemented:
- Introduced parallel test stages  
- Refactored Dockerfile to leverage cache better  
- Cleaned up unused images on runners weekly
